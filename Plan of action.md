# Plan of Action

## First Week

- **Day 1:** Get new financial data and clean up indicators - _Done_
- **Day 2:** Clean up data and normalisation method - _Done_
- **Day 3:** Clean up formulas (_reward functions_). - _Done_
- **Day 4:** Re-scale log reward, comment DSR. - _Done_
- **Day 5:** Clean up algorithm training.
  1. GAE - _Done_
  2. Bootstrapping - _Done_
  3. Hidden states - _Done_
  4. Log prob - Entropy loss may help (distribution is peaked). - _Done_
- **Day 6:**
  - Test Entropy - _Done_
  - Test Advantage normalisation for small rewards. Neither worked, the entropy converges - _Done_
- **Day 7:** Implement Tests/Logs for _Everything_.
  1. WeightsAndBiases Setup
  2. Write extra verification tests
  3. Learning Curves - you'll need to plot learning curves

## Second Week

- **Day 1:** Check all work done so far.
- **Day 2-3:** Redo Introduction, Literature Review
- **Day 4-5:** Write/Rewrite Methodology section
- **Day 6-7:** _Buffer_ (catch up on any work, verify algorithm (_recurrent PPO_) methodology)

## Third Week

- **Day 1:** Review Bug File (maybe too harsh)
- **Day 2-3:** Rewrite experimental design
- **Day 4-5:** Run noise testing, rest of experiments
- **Day 6-7:** Write results and conclusions

## Fourth Week

- **Day 1:** Read through report - _introduction, literature review_
- **Day 2:** Read through report - _methodology, Experimental design_
- **Day 3:** Read through report - _experiments and conclusions_
- **Day 4:** Read through report - _conclusions_
- **Day 5-7:** _Buffer period_
